[Verse 1]
Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks in Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am, and she doesn't give a damn about me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

[Verse 2]
Her boyfriend's a dick and he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block, and he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am, and he doesn't give a damn about me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

[Refrain]
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

[Verse 3]
Man, I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold, she's walkin' over to me
This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am? And why does she give a damn about me?

[Bridge]
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh

[Refrain]
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
